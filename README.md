# Dictation Helper

## Description 
This program aims to help English learners to make their dictation better in traditional way by training by listening and writing over and over again until they learn the spelling the word.

## Idea
There is a database of words in audio format, then a file will play and wait for you to enter the word, at the end of the process your errors and other statistics will print. 

## Suggested Sections

1. Test - The main part of program where you perform the test
2. Practices - A playground area where you can practice to correct your errors
3. Reports - Bunch of graphs, tables and numbers which demonstrate your performance. Also machine learning algorithms could involve
4. Database - Databases repositories. It would be cool if the users be able to their own databases


## Implementation
This is not a professional commercial program, first of all I'm doing to have fun. Second I'm trying to learn python programming so it's going to help me a lot to learn and understand it better. I was planning to make a terminal-based program but I changed my mind. Theses are the steps of implementation

1. It's going to be written with ```Python```
2. Use ```mysql``` as database
3. For GUI ```Qt``` will be used
4. Audio pronunciations files will get from google translate using this [API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/)

## Extra Features
1. Show the definition and synonyms and opposites of the error words in separate pan in practice section
2. Showing touch typing tips and measure the typing speed word/minutes 
3. Predict the learning curve duration of each database by machine learning algorithms
4. Practice reminder (I think it's useless but anyway maybe someone needs it)

**Note:** My spelling skill (dictation) is extremely bad but thankfully with the help of vim I can cover it :)
